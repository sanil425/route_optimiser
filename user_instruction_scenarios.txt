=== Scenario: Beach Day ===
I want to plan my day with the following constraints:

- I want to leave from Home (370 W Lancaster Ave, Haverford, PA) at 11 AM.
- Go to the cricket store (4440 Bordentown Ave, Old Bridge, NJ), which is from 1 PM to 11 PM, and I will spend 10 minutes there.
- Enjoy time at the beach at Bradshaw Beach (1 Washington Avenue, Point Pleasant Beach, NJ), for 4 hours sometime between 12 PM and 7 PM.

- Return home as early as possible.



=== Scenario: After Work Groceries ===
I want to run the following errands:

- I want to leave from Home (19 Hannum Drive, Ardmore, PA) as late as possible â€” that is, please compute the latest time I can leave while still being able to complete all the stops and return home on time.
- You should find the latest feasible departure time from Home that allows a valid route.
- I must pick up my friend from Ardmore Station (39 Station Rd, Ardmore, PA), exactly at 5:45 PM, and stop for 3 minutes.
- Go to Trader Joe's (112 Coulter Ave, Ardmore, PA). Will shop for 10 minutes.
